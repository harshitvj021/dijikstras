# Pathfinding Visualizer

A React-based application to visualize pathfinding algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, on a grid. The tool helps in understanding how these algorithms work by animating the search for the shortest path.

---

## **Features**
- Visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Interactive grid where users can set start, end, and barrier nodes.
- Dynamic animations to showcase the algorithm's execution step-by-step.

---

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

---

## **Usage**
- Set the Start Node by clicking on any grid cell.
- Set the End Node similarly.
- Add barriers by clicking and dragging on the grid.
- Click on "Visualize" to see the algorithm in action.
